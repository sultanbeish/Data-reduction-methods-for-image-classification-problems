# Data-reduction-methods-for-image-classification-problems
Image recognition is very popular problem of identifying images and categorizing them in one or several predefined distinct classes. Digital images usually require a very large number of bits, this causes critical problem for digital image data transmission and storage. Image compression is an application of data compression that encodes the original image with few bits. The objective of image compression is to reduce the redundancy of the image. Main goal of the project is to implement two data reduction techniques such as PCA and Wavelet and compare them between each other in terms of image classification problem (cat vs dogs).
